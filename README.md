Calendar Planner

This app will allow a user to create a daily plan based on work hours. It will allow the user to independantly save each hour slot to local storage in order to save it and continue to build it throughout the day. 

It will also color coordinate the day based on time of day. For example, if the current time is 0900, everything from 0400-0800 will be GREEN indicating it is in the past.

If the current time is 0900 the 0900 time block will be RED

And if the current time is 0900 then everything from 1000-2000 will be white
